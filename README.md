## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lksimpson/NailDiseaseClassification.git
cd NailDiseaseClassification
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training Models

Each model has its own Jupyter notebook for training, located in the `notebooks/` directory:

- **AlexNet**: `notebooks/alexnet-nailclassification.ipynb`
- **VGG16**: `notebooks/vgg16-nailclassification.ipynb`
- **ResNet50**: `notebooks/resnet50-nail-classification (1).ipynb`
- **DenseNet**: `notebooks/densenet-10-epoch-and-32-batch.ipynb`
- **GoogleNet**: `notebooks/GoogleNet.ipynb`
- **YOLO Detection**: `notebooks/yolo_nail_object_detection.ipynb`

Open any notebook in Jupyter and follow the training steps to train models on your dataset. All notebooks are organized in the `notebooks/` folder for better project structure.

### Running the Web Application

#### Setup Model Weights

**Important**: The application requires trained DenseNet model weights for accurate predictions.

**Option A: Use Trained Model**
- Train your model using `notebooks/densenet-10-epoch-and-32-batch.ipynb`
- Save the model weights (see `MODEL_SETUP.md` for details)
- Place the `.pth` file in the `models/` directory with one of these names:
  - `densenet_nail_disease_best.pth` (recommended)
  - `densenet_nail_disease_weights.pth`
  - `densenet_model.pth`
  - `nail_disease_classifier.pth`

**Option B: Use Environment Variable**
```bash
export DISEASE_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/your/model.pth
```

**Note**: If no trained weights are found, the app will use randomly initialized weights (not suitable for predictions). The app will automatically search for model files and display a message indicating whether weights were loaded.

For YOLO: The application will automatically download YOLOv8n for nail detection.

#### Start the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

#### Using the Application

1. Open the web interface in your browser
2. Upload a hand image (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP, max 16MB)
3. Click "Analyze Image"
4. View the results:
   - Detection visualization showing detected nail regions
   - Classification results with probability scores
   - All condition probabilities for each detected nail

## Models

### Classification Models

All five classification models are trained on the same nail disease dataset:

- **AlexNet**
- **VGG16**
- **ResNet50**
- **DenseNet**
- **GoogleNet**

### Disease Classes

The models can classify the following conditions:
- Acral Lentiginous Melanoma
- Healthy Nail
- Onychogryphosis
- Blue Finger
- Clubbing
- Pitting

### Object Detection

- **YOLOv8**: Real-time nail detection to localize nail regions before classification

### Model Interpretability

- **GradCAM**: Generates heatmaps showing which regions of the image the model focuses on for its predictions

## Dataset

The models are trained on a nail disease dataset containing images of various nail conditions. 

## Model Performance

Each model notebook contains:
- Training and validation accuracy curves
- Confusion matrices
- Classification reports
- Sample predictions

Refer to individual notebooks for detailed performance metrics.

## API Endpoints

The Flask application provides the following endpoints:

### `GET /`
Main page with upload interface

### `GET /health`
Health check endpoint
- Returns: JSON with status and model loading information
- Example response: `{"status": "healthy", "models_loaded": true}`

### `POST /predict`
Main prediction endpoint
- **Input**: Multipart form data with `image` field
- **Output**: JSON with detection and classification results
- **Response includes**:
  - `success`: Boolean indicating if prediction was successful
  - `num_nails_detected`: Number of nails found in the image
  - `results`: Array of classification results for each detected nail
    - `nail_index`: Index of the detected nail
    - `bbox`: Bounding box coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2]
    - `detection_confidence`: Confidence score for nail detection
    - `disease`: Predicted disease class
    - `probability`: Confidence score for the prediction
    - `all_probabilities`: Dictionary of probabilities for all classes
  - `detection_visualization`: Base64-encoded image with bounding boxes

## Application Architecture

### Components

1. **Backend (Flask)**: `app.py` - Main web server and API endpoints
2. **Nail Detector**: `models/nail_detector.py` - YOLO-based nail detection
3. **Disease Classifier**: `models/disease_classifier.py` - DenseNet201-based classification
4. **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript for user interface

## Development Notes

- **Model Weights Required**: The DenseNet classifier requires trained model weights to make accurate predictions. See `MODEL_SETUP.md` for instructions on how to save and load trained models.
- The YOLO model uses a general-purpose pretrained model. For better nail detection, train a custom YOLO model on nail-specific data.
- The disease classifier uses DenseNet201 architecture. You must train the model on your dataset and save the weights for production use.
- The application is designed for screening purposes only, not medical diagnosis.

### Future Improvements

1. Train a custom YOLO model for better nail detection
2. Train the DenseNet201 classifier on your dataset
3. Add model persistence and caching
4. Add user authentication and history
5. Improve error handling and validation
6. Add GradCAM visualization support
